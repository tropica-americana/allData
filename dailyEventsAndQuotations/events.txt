-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

observation says that i cannot use all the habits all the time

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

if you are not using the habits at their peak potential the reason is not you dont know how to and when to use the habits , the reason is you are not prioritizing the habits

-------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

i like the habit / desire of mukesh to stay on the goal of opening a PG , by giving him loan , i dont wanna strip him of his journey

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

i like the constant smile and sarcasm of mukesh , the costant decrease in tension and also the amazinng management offered by him, which only few people possess and are paid for it .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

i like the devotion of aryaman for his older brother which is ofcourse me .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

i am loving the simple elegant tone of smokys voice which is very soothinng , also he is a god level valorant player , which is pretty insane also .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

i like the habit of aryaman to never reject someone else opinion and also the ability to never judge the other person .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

i also the character trait of aryaman to always put first the people of his country .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

i have never seen someone with such a kind heart also . and also such a pure heart that wishes no one any harm .

-------------------------------------------------

he is among the only few people including mukesh and ashish bharti that have access to my consience .

-------------------------------------------------

also bhole also has direct access to my consience .

the piyush chandras method of doing everything with a purpose in mind is highly effective in reducing radnom time losses and massively increases the productivity .

the way you initiate a conversation is everything . if you do it by speaking you will speak the entire convo . but if tou begin by asking and listening you will listen the entire convo .

if you can defend against the questions of rishab and raunak then the social type of relationship is jsut amazing .

porn addiction and sex addiciton seem indolent , there final form occurs when you go out to have sex and your dick does not stand straight and condom breaks and you get exposed to aids and hepatitis b

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

among other things spending time finding and talking to real doctors and approcging real women will often prevent severe sexual disasters

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

cues trigerring the sexual disaster i had today included overproductive day , increased optimism and good nutritional status and more than 30 day gap between previous sexual encounter , good social relations , completed course of post exposure prophylaxis

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------

mukesh has high degree of kindness and consiecous ness which is evident by many examples includign being able to fight for the protection of a girl .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

chandan rejected raunak the right to eat if that changes anything .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

i am feeling nauseated and i dont know why . maybe because of all the shit i went through yesterday .

keyword variable driven system or vds

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

using mutex for each model will prove faster as you will not have to lock every model for manipulating each individual model which is good KW vds 

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

current advancement in vds is that we are gonna change the values in the unordered_map stored inside each individual model and that accounts for a lot of data and lot of customizability but will reduce the performance of the programme as a whole but with each customization will also increase the performance of the programme .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

the thing i should be able to control each individual variable using the command line of each individual model , and i will write the processcommandlinethread in such a way that allows it .

smoky does not mind being roasted about biotech but only when done sarcastically

when conflicted with his opinion older mayank would just shout , and thats not a flaw , thats a habit and i dont criticize him for that thats the way he is .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

mayank often deals good with criticism like apko kya pata , apne kya dekha h , but not with apko pata h and the reason is yet to be known .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

mayank takes me for food , which is not obliged to do and the obligation was forced to him and he wants payment as kitkat which is acceptable to me .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

mayank has high cholesterol , stopping growth in his career , familial and money problems , marriage problems , mild personality improvements pending and i am not obliged to support him for it but the least i can do to express my kindness is listen gracefully .

-------------------------------------------------

rishab sometimes looks like he is sad from inside . he beleives in illuminatis . his destiny was written by a pandit and he is obliged to become a ias , his girlfriend is not to non toxic and keeps in touch with him .

that last person you should take advice from are your siblings , look where they got you , megha didnt even tell you to take vmmc , ashish didnt even let you take vmmc , look how stupid their advice is about usmle , this is not saying that they dont want the best for you , its just that this is free advice from unwise people . who the fuck takes advice from family bro .

one of the best teachings of piyush are that never try to change any one without their consent .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

raunak is among the highly rudest and agressive and direct people i have seen , but also he can also at times share that much warmth , and if someone asks if i want to change anything about him , i will say nothing , i will change nothing about anybody .

expressive are the people who have little to no backing by the education or achievements , they dont wanna work and also they wanna solve everything just by talking . these are the most dangerous types of people if they infect the team and unfortunately you have a significant expressive component . these people can often talk very amazing bull shit and are among the very charming personality types . the way to deal with these kinds of people is by keeping them seperate from the team as they will cause lot of time wasting and bitching about the fellow team members . apparently mukesh is not the expressive type but has some expressive component . some of the expressive types i know are komal -> expressive + analytical , anshu bhaiya , varun mishra 

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

if you can change the persons actions via logic , then thats a strong analytical trait .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

if a person has a very strong commandmend towards a goal , then thats a very strong drivers trait .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

some of the commong people i know and identify are ashish -> analytical and amiable , megha -> driver , mummy -> driver , father -> analytical 

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

donald trump and robert kiyosaki are apparently a mixtue of expressive and amiable and thats why they prove so effective for me

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

people on the podcasts are highly higly likely to be expressive people

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

the foods that should be avoided for better health are gums , nuts , raw nuts , anything hard , predominant chewing on the right side , and regular brushing should be included in the agenda for maintaining better dental health .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

common distractions while studying radiology is food ,terminal , coffee , gate knocking , mayank etc and these should be constantly kept in chekc

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

apparently both rudra and smoky are expressive personalities shown by their lack of interest for innovation and mediocre mindset of comfortable living and they appear analytical which might prove very deadly .

-------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------

sachin verma was a expressive as an amiable . that means his true personality type was expressive but he wanted others to beleive him as an amiable person .

one the key differentiating feature between a flattering and a praise is , flattering is generalized , a praise is specific

-------------------------------------------------

i talked to arun sir , and i didnt do the bullshit about exams and career , and other stuff , i talked about his health and what are his current problems and that marked a significant difference in the quality and the content of the conversations , thinking and talking in terms of other persons perspective will bring about a plethora of change .

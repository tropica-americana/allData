places where habit 1 can be best used 
1. when some one points out a flaw in you 
2. when you did something which you thought was wrong in the slightest accept is as fast as you can 
3. when something you did does not align with the views of the other person 
4. when you have been using a tool wrong for a long time and someone points it out to you

--------------
HABIT 2
the habit is best suited in situations like 
-> when you are asked to do something which you dont want to do you can just lie and say that you are busy but will do later 
-> you are not supposed to lie to anyone , when lying is the best part of any conversation 
-> you are not supposed to eat chicken 
-> you are supposed to study a lot because you have been gifted with a good brain and you are not supposed to waste it
-> you are supposed to be a good person and not be sarcastic to anyone
-> i am supposed to take care of my parents just becaue they took care of me and 
   not because i care for them and want them to be happy 

--------------
HABIT 3
you can use this habit in ways like 
-> you can use sarcasm to build people up 
-> you should not speak the flaw in any person 
-> do not collide with the views of any person
-> do not feel bad for a flaw in you 
a person who cannot himself will always find trouble accepting others 
-> rephrase the sentence like a drop of honey 

--------------
HABIT 4
some major events in life are not under your control and when tried to control
lead to unnecessary stress and anxiety
-> dog dies
-> someone acts in a way that they usually dont
-> change in state of sorroundings or the country 
-> you made a mistake in the past that you cannot change and cannot change in the future 
also 
for example . for anger episode you can use habit number 9 but for 
past anger episodes nothing can be done 
-> change in state of the currency 
-> parents health condition if they dont change their habits
-> opinions of the other person are complete and utter garbage 

--------------
HABIT 5
i am naturally good at this habit , but 
only if i call it 
--------------
HABIT 6
rather than looking on the current state , an investor looks at the direction 
-> instead of where you are with your current habits you should focus on where you are headed 
-> if you are losing something over time , you are gonna lose it more only , because the direction where it is headed is negative 
-> if direction is net positive for something , you will only accumulate more of it
-> if a person loses 1 friend everym month and makes 1 every 2 months , eventually he will have no friends 
-> if a person makes 1 major mistake every month in 10 years he will have made 120 mistakes
    that is hard for anyone to survive if the person does not learn from them 
->  investing is about exponential growth of good or bad habits 
    in earlier stages they are stored in a imaginary container but when they take pace 
    they can cause real damage and real gain 
->  if a person makes hasty dicisions but does not learn from them , he will become a garbage pile 
    of hasty dicisions
--------------
HABIT 7

use an iphone or an ipad camera

--------------
HABIT 8
you can use this habit in situations like

    but you should not lose hope 
    the ability to solve a certain problem increases with time if the problem is held 
    for a long enough time 
-> never think this is the end for any more possibilities , the task of a human is when 
    face with a problem , he should continue to explore , to find solutions 
-> the one dinies this habit dies a horrible death and a lonely one 
-> the enemy of this habit is "oh ! i am fine . life is fine the way it is . i dont need to 
    explore more possibilities . i am fine with what i have "

graham loves buying stocks at a discount
---------------------------------------------------------------
the question is whether how to buy stocks at such a discount 
---------------------------------------------------------------
they more they grow the less they can grow 
----------------------------------------------------------------
graham suggests buying growth stock at a low PE ration of around 20 - 25 and not even that 
he wouldnt buy such stocks at such PR ratios 
----------------------------------------------------------------
buy amazing companies at amazing prices 
----------------------------------------------------------------
put all your eggs in one basket and watch the basket 
----------------------------------------------------------------
writer suggests that to get valuable resources to find value investments 
----------------------------------------------------------------
its not about timing the market but rather pricing the market  
----------------------------------------------------------------
price is what you pay , value is what you get 
----------------------------------------------------------------
if you get out the bubble of growth stocks , you can always find amazing companies at amazing discounts 
----------------------------------------------------------------
never buy 1/3 rd above the tangible assets of the company 
----------------------------------------------------------------
the thoughts of selling only come to my mind before buying after that they dont 
----------------------------------------------------------------
dont get flown only by the tangible assets of the company but also look at its cash flow mate 
------------------  --------------------------------------------
my expense is expensive

i dont invest money in people
-----------------------------------------------------------------
if you want to invest anything in people , money should be the last choice 
------------------------------------------------------------------
you cannot  suffer the loss of market cap if you dont sell the stock

apparently i am good at absoulte risk and relative risk and other biostats 
math questions

misclassification bias -> when you have a variable that is not measured
correctly
that is 
measurement of exposure status is measured incorreclty 
measurement of outcome is measured incorrectly
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

** rare disease assumption implies that if the incidence of the disease is low 
then the relative risk can be calculated as the odds ratio ** 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

positive correlation -> when the two variables are moving in the same   
direction
negative correlation -> when the two variables are moving in opposite
directions
value > 0 -> positive correlation 
value < 0 -> negative correlation

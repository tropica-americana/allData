changing the angular momentum of the particle is an art of its own    
       
obseravtions

1. angular momentum resists the change in its direction and amplitude 

2. the larger the anular momentum the harder it gets to change it 

3. angular momentum can be changed only by the torque 

4 . there is change in speed of rotation when there is change in change in 
angular momentum 
that is d-d-angularmomentum 

5 . the phenomenon of wobbling is also seen in fidget spinner , when to 
try to change the axis of rotation of the figet spinner , it wobbles 
rather than staying in that axis 

6 . particles wobble under gravity , particles wobble under magnetic 
fields  , explaination is simple , when you push the edge of the fidget 
spinner the the torque can be calculateed by right hand thumb rule , it 
wobbles rather than simply change its angular momentum is because the 
gravity does not allow a static tilted object , same with external 
magnetic field  


7. the question arises will the particle wobble in the abscence of 
external magnetic field or gravitational fields and the answer is probably 
no 

8 . does the wobbling depend on the direction of angular momentum probably 
it does not

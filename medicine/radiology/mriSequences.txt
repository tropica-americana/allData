1. T1-weighted:
   - Description: Produces high signal from fat and low signal from water.
   - Use: Used for anatomical detail and identifying pathology such as tumors, inflammation, or bleeding.
   - Prominent Structures: Fat, muscle, grey matter, white matter.
   - Connection with other Sequences: Contrast is opposite to T2: fluid appears dark, fat appears bright.

2. T2-weighted:
   - Description: Produces high signal from water and low signal from fat.
   - Use: Used to detect edema and inflammation, and to visualize fluid-filled structures.
   - Prominent Structures: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), edema, inflammation.
   - Connection with other Sequences: Fluid is bright, fat is relatively dark.

3. FLAIR (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery):
   - Description: Similar to T2-weighted, but CSF signal is suppressed.
   - Use: Used to detect lesions near ventricles or in sulci where CSF signal may obscure them.
   - Prominent Structures: Lesions near ventricles or sulci.
   - Connection with other Sequences: Essentially T2 with CSF appearing dark (like in T1).

4. DWI (Diffusion Weighted Imaging):
   - Description: Measures the diffusion of water molecules.
   - Use: Useful in acute stroke imaging, abscesses, and differentiation of epidermoid cysts from arachnoid cysts.
   - Prominent Structures: Acute ischemic stroke, abscesses, cysts.
   - Connection with other Sequences: Unique sequence, not directly comparable to T1 or T2.

5. T1 with Gadolinium (contrast):
   - Description: Gadolinium enhances areas with a disrupted blood-brain barrier.
   - Use: Used for tumor imaging, inflammation, infection, and vascular studies.
   - Prominent Structures: Tumors, inflammation, infection.
   - Connection with other Sequences: T1-weighted, but contrast-enhanced.

6. T2* (T2 Star) Gradient Echo:
   - Description: Sensitive to magnetic susceptibility differences within tissue.
   - Use: Used to detect hemorrhage and calcifications.
   - Prominent Structures: Hemorrhage, calcifications.
   - Connection with other Sequences: Unique sequence, not directly comparable to T1 or T2.

7. SWI (Susceptibility Weighted Imaging):
   - Description: Very sensitive to differences in magnetic susceptibility.
   - Use: Used to detect small amounts of blood, iron, and calcium.
   - Prominent Structures: Microhemorrhages, venous structures, iron deposition.
   - Connection with other Sequences: More sensitive to blood and iron than T2* gradient echo.

8. MRA (Magnetic Resonance Angiography):
   - Description: Used to image arteries and veins.
   - Use: Used to detect vascular abnormalities like aneurysms and dissections.
   - Prominent Structures: Arteries, veins.
   - Connection with other Sequences: Often used with gadolinium to enhance blood vessels.

9. MRV (Magnetic Resonance Venography):
   - Description: Specialized for imaging veins.
   - Use: Used to detect venous thrombosis and other venous problems.
   - Prominent Structures: Veins, particularly dural sinuses.
   - Connection with other Sequences: Complementary to MRA but focused on veins.

10. DWI-ADC (Apparent Diffusion Coefficient):
    - Description: A calculated image based on DWI that quantifies diffusion.
    - Use: Used to differentiate

Even in a macroscopic body, a bulk nonvanishing spin excess is not enough to guarantee a detectable signal. In a classical picture (which is derived from the quantum underpinnings in Ch. 5), the magnetization vector (the magnetic moment vector density due to the spin population) must be tipped away from the external field direction in order to initiate preces- sion. The magnetization corresponding to the aggregate proton spins will therefore produce a changing magnetic flux in any nearby ‘receive’ coil (Ch. 7) as it precesses around the exter- nal magnetic field. To accomplish this, as discussed in Chs. 3 and 4, the magnetization can be rotated away from its alignment along the B0 axis (i.e., from its longitudinal direction) by applying a radiofrequency (rf) magnetic field for a short time (an rf ‘pulse’). This rf pulse is produced from another nearby ‘transmit’ coil (which may be the same as the receive coil, provided its radiofrequency is tuned to the Larmor frequency; see Fig. 1.2). This is the resonance condition in MRI described earlier and it ensures that the precessing spin gets a continuously synchronized push (rotation) away from the longitudinal direction (the z-axis,

write me a shell script that does the following 
it takes a text file provided as a variable in the script itself 
dislays the first  line 
when user presses enter it displays the next line 
it does that till the user reaches the end of the file 
after reaching the end it prompts the user if he wanna go again 
if the user presses y then it repeats again from the first line  
otherwise if the user presses any other key the whole process exits 
and also the output of each line in the terminal should be blue color 
after the end
it dispays the time it took to iterate through all the lines combined  in
this format 
"you tooke x  minutes || y seconds to read z number of lines "  

the problem with the code you have provided is that 
it is displaying all the lines at once and 
there is -e prefix comming infront of eveyline 
i want each individual line to be displayed after the user presses 
enter or return key 




you can use a formula like this 
read someradomvariable 
echo -e nextline

here are all the skills i possess 

i have passed step 1 exam 

my AIR was 450 , i dont know how to use it in my CV to give myself an 
advantage 

i studied from maulana azad medical college 

i did my 1 year year of internship in lok nayak hospital and 
GB pant hospital 

where i learned
a plethora of surgical , gynaecological , and medical cases due to 
working in  the place of highest patient load in the country 
 
how to put central lines 
**patient dealing skills
using response and reaction to my advantage 
persistence 
constant reading and interpretition of patient vitals 
a plethora of radiological presentations in my radiology posting 
among the best colleges i picked up the best habits from my elite peers
deal with long and strenous working hours
reading blood reports 
**taking detailed patient history**  
taking detailed  psychiatric history 
differential diagnosis
Clinical assessment
Emergency medicine
Interdisciplinary collaboration
Time management
Surgical assistance
Basic life support (BLS)
Immunization administration
Pre- and post-operative care
Public health awareness 
Palliative care
Trauma management
Physical examination techniques
...........any other skills taught in MBBS 
--------------------------------------

these are the courses i have completed  on udemy and i want to make them 
sound usefull for the reader as i want to apply in any research related 
to radiology --> and machine learning and AI is a big part of it  

my optimism to bring machines closer to medicine led me to know 
about the machines 

Shell Scripting: Discover How to Automate Command Line Tasks

Beginning C++ Programming - From Beginner to Beyond

100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023

--------------------------------------

skills 

i have seen over 1000 radiology cases on radiopedia with an daily average of 
10 cases per day 

i am fairly good at computing , and analysing numbers given in any research 

i can convert any mathematical tablles used in research in 2d or 3d models
and perform statistical analysis on them  

i have a github repository among which i have a 3d models repository 
 and fairly experienced with git 

i am on a personality development programme which i can use in my CV with the 
permission of my mentor 

i read the physcis behind the mri machine and fairly 
optimistic at the future of mri , and want to make the technology cheaper and
faster 

aspirations --> fields i would be interested in doing research in
althoguh some of them are heavly researched i would still like to 
pursue them  
1 . make the machines used in medicine and make them cheaper , with improving
the speed and the accuracy of the diagnosis most likely MRI machines 
2 . working on braing machine interface while focusing on incresing 
the frequency of reading and stroing brain waves 
3 . using digitalization to increase the inter-medical-personell network 
to aid the diagnosis via simultaneous inputs of multiple medical personell 
while decreasing the ease and improving the ease of input reading 
and rendering output of each medical personell  
4 . imprving the access to the medical data availaible to any medical -persone
ll at any point of time and with reducing the time to acess the data to 1/3rd 
5 . using AI to guide , modify , and improve the process of innovation 

6 .taking a whole another approach to radiological imaging and generating 
a new value in the radiology community
